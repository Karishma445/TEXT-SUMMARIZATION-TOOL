Text Summarization Tool using Natural Language Processing (NLP)
📌 Description
This project is a simple yet effective Text Summarization Tool developed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It is designed as part of the CODTECH internship Task 1, with the goal of showcasing the power of modern machine learning models to automatically generate concise summaries from lengthy articles or paragraphs. Summarization is one of the most practical applications of NLP, especially valuable in fields like journalism, education, healthcare, and law, where large volumes of textual data need to be quickly understood and processed.

Text summarization involves the process of shortening a document while preserving its key information and meaning. This tool uses abstractive summarization, which means it doesn't just extract and copy parts of the original text, but instead rewrites the content in a new, coherent, and concise form — much like how a human would summarize a passage.

The summarization functionality is powered by a pre-trained transformer model from Hugging Face’s transformers library. Specifically, it leverages models like BART or T5, which have been fine-tuned for summarization tasks. These models understand the context of the input text and can generate summaries that are both accurate and human-like.

The tool has been implemented in Python, and is designed as a standalone script. It prompts the user for input (or uses a predefined article), processes the text, and outputs a summarized version. This makes it extremely user-friendly and easy to test. Even users with no prior experience in AI or NLP can run the script and get meaningful results.

🔍 How It Works
The script uses the pipeline API from the transformers library to create a summarization pipeline.

When text is passed to the pipeline, it is tokenized and fed into a deep learning model that generates a summary.

Parameters such as max_length and min_length are used to control the length of the output summary.

The tool outputs the original article and the summary in the terminal.

💡 Why Text Summarization?
In today’s digital age, people are often overwhelmed by information. Reading through long reports, news articles, or research papers can be time-consuming. Text summarization helps by:

Saving time for readers

Improving comprehension of large documents

Assisting students and researchers with quick overviews

Enabling content filtering in apps and news aggregators

This tool demonstrates how NLP can be used to automate this task efficiently.
